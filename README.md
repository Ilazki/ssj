### A better ssh for Grey Hack
SSJ is a replacement for the built-in ssh utility in the Grey Hack game.  It's intended to provide a more powerful alternative that behaves a bit more like the real ssh.

### Features
* Configuration file for saving hosts similar to real-world .ssh/config
* Command-line host specification is closer to real ssh
* "Jump" option for multi-host bounce

### Building
SSJ is made with the [gsc](https://github.com/Ilazki/gsc) GreyScript preprocessor. For users without gsc, `ssj_generated.gst` is a standalone file generated by `gsc ssj.src --src` that can be used with the built-in build tool.
